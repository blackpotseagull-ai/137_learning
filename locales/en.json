  "about_story_p1": "StudyHub started as a small project by a group of students and life-long learners who were frustrated with the 'cram and forget' cycle. We spent countless hours digging into research papers on memory, cognition, and effective learning strategies.",
  "about_story_p2": "What we discovered was a treasure trove of insights that completely changed how we approached learning. We built the first version of our Review Tool to apply these principles to our own studies. The results were so transformative that we knew we had to share it with the world. Thus, StudyHub was born – a platform dedicated to helping everyone study smarter, not just harder.",
