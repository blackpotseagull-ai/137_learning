  "what_is_137_title": "What Exactly is the 1-3-7 Method?",
  "what_is_137_p1": "The 1-3-7 method is a simple yet powerful learning schedule based on the principles of **Spaced Repetition**. Instead of cramming information all at once, you strategically review it over increasing intervals. Specifically, you review new material:",
  "what_is_137_li1": "**1 day** after you first learn it.",
  "what_is_137_li2": "**3 days** after the initial learning.",
  "what_is_137_li3": "**7 days** after the initial learning.",
  "what_is_137_p2": "This structured review process interrupts the natural process of forgetting, strengthening your neural pathways and cementing knowledge into your long-term memory. It transforms learning from a short-term sprint into a long-term, sustainable marathon.",
  "science_title": "The Science Behind the Magic: The Forgetting Curve",
  "science_p1": "In the 19th century, psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered the \"Forgetting Curve,\" a concept that describes how our memory of new information fades over time if we don't try to retain it. The curve shows a steep drop in memory retention shortly after learning, which then levels off.",
  "science_p2": "**Spaced repetition is the antidote to the Forgetting Curve.** Each time you review the information at the intervals suggested by the 1-3-7 method, you \"reset\" the curve. The forgetting process slows down with each review, meaning you need to review less frequently over time to maintain the same level of retention. This tool helps you do exactly that, at the optimal moments.",
  "science_img_caption": "The Forgetting Curve shows how information is lost over time. Spaced reviews (like 1-3-7) push the curve up, leading to long-term retention.",
  "tips_title": "Practical Tips for Maximizing Your Learning",
  "tips_p1": "Using the tool is a great first step. Combine it with these techniques for even better results:",
  "tips_li1": "<strong>Active Recall:</strong> Don't just passively re-read your notes. When a review is due, try to recall the information from memory first, *before* checking your material. This effortful retrieval is what builds strong memories.",
  "tips_li2": "<strong>Elaboration:</strong> Try to explain the concept in your own words, as if you were teaching it to someone else. Connect it to what you already know.",
  "tips_li3": "<strong>Chunking:</strong> Break down large topics into smaller, manageable \"chunks\" of information. Add these smaller chunks to the review tool instead of a huge, vague topic.",
  "tips_li4": "<strong>Consistency is Key:</strong> The magic of this method lies in consistency. Try to make your reviews a daily habit. Our tool is designed to make this as easy as possible.",

  "about_mission_title": "Our Mission",
  "about_mission_p1": "In a world overflowing with information, the ability to learn effectively is more important than ever. However, many of us still rely on outdated and inefficient study habits. At StudyHub, our mission is to change that.",
  "about_mission_p2": "We are dedicated to providing learners of all ages with tools and knowledge based on proven cognitive science principles, such as spaced repetition and active recall. We aim to make learning a more strategic and less stressful process, empowering you to achieve your goals faster and retain knowledge for longer.",
  "about_story_title": "Our Story",
  "about_story_p1": "StudyHub started as a small project by a group of students and life-long learners who were frustrated with the 'cram and forget' cycle. We spent countless hours digging into research papers on memory, cognition, and effective learning strategies.",
  "about_story_p2": "What we discovered was a treasure trove of insights that completely changed how we approached learning. We built the first version of our Review Tool to apply these principles to our own studies. The results were so transformative that we knew we had to share it with the world. Thus, StudyHub was born – a platform dedicated to helping everyone study smarter, not just harder.",
